*Untitled [Cardinal’s Message]* was originally made on invitation from artist and curator Israel Martínez for an exhibition at Museo de la Ciudad in Guadalajara, Mexico. This sound installation presents six different speeches that Cardinal Juan Sandoval Íñiguez gave through the AM radio program Alleluia Today is Sunday. 

Through these short speeches, Sandoval Íñiguez’ preaches, from his very particular point of view, about sex, abortion, and general sins within the population. Guadalajara is the second largest city in Mexico, and one of the most conservative. Cardinal Juan Sandoval Íñiguez was known for his awareness on the importance of using media to build public opinion.

Artwork commissioned for the exhibition at Guadalajara City Museum. Curator Israel Martinez. Guadalajara, Mexico.

Multimedia installation *Untitled [Cardinal’s Message]* is presented with apostasy forms for visitors to ask to be erased from the Baptism books from the Catholic Church.
