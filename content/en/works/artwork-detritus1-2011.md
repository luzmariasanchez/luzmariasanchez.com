Detritus1 is an audiovisual installation by Luz María Sánchez that presents different elements dealing with the 2006-2012 war against drug trafficking in Mexico and its devastating results among civilians. Detritus1 consist on a small-scale video of more than 10,862 digital images taken from Mexican national electronic media over the period of 12.11.06-11.30.12. Images are intervened, and then projected in a double large-scale screen, in random sequence, each during a 2 second lapse. In this version of the project, the sound component come from a 8 channel sound installation. The sound is the result of the processing of one of the political speeches former Mexican President Felipe Calderon gave to the media. During the last 6 years, Mexican President declared war against drug trafficking. Since then, there have been at least 60,000 civilians dead. Media has been portraying details on this account, cooperating with the normalization of violence as part of the new reality.
