Stereo Sound, Digital Video. \
Dimensions: variable. \
Duration: undetermined.

Chronicled in this sound and video installation are the daily activities of a clochard over the course of three days. Inhabiting the streets of San Antonio’s Southside the man on the video makes daily visits to a recycling center as witnessed in a year-long record of his daily habits. Condensed to frames from three separate days the clochard repeats his ritual: unpacks all of his belongings, filters out his recycling products, cleans them, sells them, and then repacks all of his belongings and moves on—only to begin again.
