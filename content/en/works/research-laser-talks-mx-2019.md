**LEONARDO_LASER TALKS MEX**

Initiator and Chair of **LASER TALKS MEX**, the first initiative of its kind in Mexico and in a Spanish-speaking country. Through ongoing collaboration with **LEONARDO/ISAST**, Sánchez established a formal institutional partnership between the **LEONARDO initiative** and **Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM)**. This connection led to the production of the **Leonardo LASER Talks Mexican chapter**.

The initiative was part of the broader [**Arts, Sciences, Humanities, and Citizenship (ACHC)**](https://www.luzmariasanchez.com/work/research-achc-2016) research network project, which Sánchez launched during her tenure as Head of the Department of Arts and Humanities at UAM (2015–2019). **LASER TALKS MEX** paused in 2021 but remains a pioneering effort in promoting transdisciplinary dialogue in Mexico.
