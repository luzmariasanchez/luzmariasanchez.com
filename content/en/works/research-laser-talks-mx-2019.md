LASER TALKS MEX was the first initiative of its kind in Mexico—and in a Spanish-speaking country. Through Sánchez ongoing collaboration with LEONARDO ISAST (International Society for Arts Sciences and Technologies), she was able to establish an institutional connection between the LEONARDO initiative and Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM). Later Sánchez produced the Leonardo Laser Talks Mexican chapter. 

This initiative was part of the larger Arts, Sciences, Humanities, and Citizenship [ACHC] research network project that Sánchez’s initiated as Head of Department of Arts and Humanities (2015-2019) at UAM.
