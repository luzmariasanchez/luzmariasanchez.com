Multi-channel Sound Installation. 8 to 24 trumpet speakers, 2-3 amplifiers, 2-3 CD players. \
Dimensions: variable. \
Duration: 30 minutes (original loop).


This sound installation captures the swelling aggression on the US-Mexico border region employing sound generated by radio frequencies used by the Nuevo Laredo police. Nuevo Laredo is a border city opposite its twin, Laredo, Texas, on the other side of the Rio Grande in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Sampled together are recent and pre-recorded recordings of activity registered on the regional police frequencies. The main sound sample that is the focal point of the piece transcribes a fight between the Nuevo Laredo police and a criminal group not identified. The US-Mexico border region is effectually involved in an armed battle with organized crime and drug lords with a violence level that caused the US to close its consulate in Nuevo Laredo the first week of August (2005). Over the past few years the violence in Nuevo Laredo has escalated to levels never seen before by Mexican authorities and civilians. During 2005 year alone, the homicide rate has more than doubled including the execution of 18 police in addition to 75 kidnappings of civilians for ransom.
