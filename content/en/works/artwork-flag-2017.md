Single-Channel digital video, colour. [looped\] \
Dimensions: 1,280 x 720 px. \
Duration: 4 min 19 s. 


Between 15 and 16 September 2013, Hurricane Manuel hit the city of Acapulco in Mexico. This was the sixteenth tropical cyclone of the 2013 Pacific hurricane season. Although it did not go beyond Category 1, it caused severe damage to the city due to its combination with Hurricane Ingrid, which originated simultaneously in the Gulf of Mexico. The artist was in the area on these dates and documented the state in which the Mexican flag was left.
