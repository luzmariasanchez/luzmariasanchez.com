Four floor fans. \
Dimensions: variable. \
Duration: undetermined.


This sound installation focuses on concepts of sound and space that exist independently of mechanical audio (digital or analogue). Installed within a small gallery at the MUCA Roma (the Museo de Ciencias y Arte) as part of the International Sound Festival of Mexico City, four medium floor fans were attached to the walls, each facing the other. Emanating from the piece, in addition to a continuous breeze, was sound: the sound of the fan blades, the sound of the windy atmosphere created by the fans, and the sound from the various ways the atmosphere was penetrated by the audience.
