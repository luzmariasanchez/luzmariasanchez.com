An experimental transdisciplinary multimedia research-creation project, *power · room* explores political power through media narratives in contemporary Mexico. Based on audiovisual content generated in real-time and the mechanisms of mass communication in the 21st century, the artwork investigates the mechanisms in which actions of power take place, often on live media After a series of artworks in which the artist questioned how the civilian population survives in a situation of extreme violence in the absence of the state, the artist extends the quest to ask: Where is the State? Or even better: Who is the State?
