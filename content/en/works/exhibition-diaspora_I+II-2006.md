*diaspora I / II* combines Sánchez’s experiments into the nature of sound with a sensitivity towards her physical and cultural surroundings. Investigating Mexico’s social plight, she creates two spaces, one sonic—*2487*—and the other architectural/material—*riverbank*—to reanimate the complexities of the United States/Mexico border.
