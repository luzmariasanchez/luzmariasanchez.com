*Untitled [planes / the lure of Progress [I]* is a multichannel sound piece that addresses climate disaster and the defeat of the concept of Progress. Immersive sound allows to reflect critically on dimensions of the Capitalocene through a dystopic soundscape: planes crossing the space. The sound work presents sonic contrails – the acoustic hums and roars, the equivalent of the vapour, line-shaped, white clouds produced by aircraft engine exhaust. Sound sources are recordings of sonic contrails made by commercial aircraft en route to Mexico City airport. \
