*Closed Circuit* is an experimental transdisciplinary multimedia research-creation project. It handles visual and sound elements in a non-linear way, and incorporates the participation of the public as a performative element. 

*Closed Circuit* addresses Samuel Beckett’s confinement spaces where the exterior becomes a secondary reference. It nurtures from Beckett’s text-works The Lost Ones as well as his works for television, especially the German productions made for Süddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR): He Joe (1965), Ghost Trio (1975), …but the clouds… (1976), Quad (1980), Nacht und Träume (1982) and Was Wo (1983). 

In *Closed Circuit* the pre-recorded sound element comes as a cold machine-like voice that introduces data of an autopsy. The multiple channels of videos address different types of private-home interiors: living room area, a non-specific room based on the filming of the point where wall and ceiling touch, and three more rooms based on their flooring – wooden floor and white and black mosaic. And only one gaze to the exterior: a park. *Closed Circuit* was premiered during the BECKETT-MEXICO [Encounter 01], at the Arts Forum of the National Centre for the Arts, Mexico City.
