Silkscreens on 300 gsm Fabriano paper. \
Dimensions: 55 cm x 70 cm.


Multidisciplinary art-research project. Composed of artworks created through digital time-based media—photography, video, sound—and analogue media—slides, drawing, prints. 

The first outcome of the project is an edition of eight silkscreens in seven colours, printed on 300 gsm Fabriano paper, edition of 25, paper dimensions 50cm x 35cm, signed, numbered and dated by the artist, and produced by Ediciones Axolotl in Guadalajara, Mexico. 

*Post-Corpus* explores the possibilities of representation of violence bridging the gap between the violence of the first decades of the 20th century and those of the early decades of the XXI century in Mexico. 

Beyond the perpetrators of violence during the post-revolutionary period in Mexico, and the perpetrators of violence from 2006 to date, the project presents the individual as cornered and defenceless. 

The project is organized around key-works by Mexican muralist José Clemente Orozco: *Hangman* and *Mass grave*, both from the series *The Horrors of the Revolution* (1926–1928), *Lynching* (1930), *Corpse* (1943), *Sketch for Ballet II* (1945), and *Human Sacrifice* (from the series Los Teules, 1947), works all hopelessly valid when talking about the horrors of the present. *Post-Corpus* revisits some of the Orozco's body of work from before 1950.
