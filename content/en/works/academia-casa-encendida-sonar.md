In this lecture, Sánchez Cardona draws on the research she conducted on various sound theorists, including Douglas Kahn, Gregory Whitehead and Brandon LaBelle, who, at the end of the 20th century, proposed the concept of 'sound' as a tool and as an element of meaning, that allowed for a timely reading of the importance of the 'audible' in the development of what we now know as a solid and continuous practice.
