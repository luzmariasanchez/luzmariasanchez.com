*Vis. [un]necessary force_3 started as an artistic project, with a grassroots approach involving a collaborative and participatory audio-visual cartography. The project exposes the shocking fact that over 60,000 people were the victims of forced disappearance in Mexico in 2019, often with the complicity of police or military forces. Although the project size remains small, the artist has created a powerful tool that encourages citizens who self-organize to perform investigations to co-create a document of these human rights violations, to expose and share with the world the wrongdoing and violations of power, and to build a digital memory for affected communities.*

Jury: Chiaki Hayashi, Dietmar Offenhuber, Irini Papadimitriou, Farah Salka, and Thomas Gegenhuber.
