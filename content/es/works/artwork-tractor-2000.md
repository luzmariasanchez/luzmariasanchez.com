Video Installation, stereophonic sound. \
Dimensions: variable. \
Duration: 4:20 minutes.


Created during a workshop in the Montesquieu Mountains near the city of Vic, Spain, and under the tutorship of artist Santiago Sierra, the image and sound reveal a macro view of a John Deere tractor moving back and forth in its duty to cut the grass. The sound and video installation seeks to overwhelm the viewer through the large-scale projection and the high levels of sound. Both the video and audio were recorded up-close, expanding and enclosing individual elements of this redundant mechanical activity in the countryside.
