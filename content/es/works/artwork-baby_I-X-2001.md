Sound Piece. 10 sound loops. \
Duration: 15 seconds each.



*BABY* is a sound piece, produced in multiple. Only one word is used in this investigation into language and sound, “baby.” The word is recorded at different intonations, but not digitally manipulated. It is edited so as to have the beginning and the end of the spoken word heard simultaneously and then repeated for 15 seconds. Each track is a loop and meant to be played for an indefinite duration.
