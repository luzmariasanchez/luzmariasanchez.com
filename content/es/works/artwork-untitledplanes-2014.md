Multi-channel sound installation. \
32.2 multichannel sound system, computer, sounds. \
Dimensions: variable. \
Duration: variable. 

Technologies of spatialisation and immersive sound allow us to reflect critically on dimensions of the Anthropocene and Capitalocene through a dystopic soundscape: planes crossing the space slowly, over and over. The artwork presents sonic contrails –the acoustic equivalent of the vapour, line-shaped, white clouds produced by aircraft engine exhaust or changes in air pressure. Through immersive sounds, ideas of the devastating effects of human activity are placed in the centre of a speculative dialogue. Sound sources are recordings of sonic contrails made by commercial aircraft en route to Mexico City airport.
