Collaborative and participatory audio-visual cyber-cartography for mobile systems and web data visualisation.

SINSONTE was conceived and produced specifically for South of San Antonio in Texas (United States). It uses digital technology to engage communities in the [re]discovery and [re]construction of their surroundings. SINSONTE has three fundamental components:

(1) the environment [the landscape, soundscape, the ecological, the surroundings]\
(2) the social [community-based, social-engagement, education]\
(3) the technological [sound (re)construction, geo-localization, archive, mobile application]
 
SINSONTE explores concepts of acoustic ecology and sound practices; employs digital technology for data recording and data transmission; and develops a strong educational and community-based approach. To facilitate participants [re]cognizing and [re]constructing their surroundings, individuals within a community are invited to engage in a series of outdoor activities—sound walking, deep listening, and field recording—using their personal hardware as recording gear—mobile phones as sound recorders—and a dedicated app designed specifically for this project.
 
Participants are invited to discover the sonic pulse of their surrounding space while listening to a final mix of individualised micro-soundscapes. 

The project got a production grant and was awarded a Climate Change Artist Commission by the Land Heritage Institute in San Antonio, United States.
