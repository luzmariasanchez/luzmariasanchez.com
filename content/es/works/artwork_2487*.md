Generative data [visuals].\
Dimensions: variable.\
Duration: undetermined.


2487* records the names of two thousand four hundred and eighty-seven people out of an estimated eight thousand who have died attempting to cross the border between Mexico and the United States since 1993. The generative work was presented during the Tsonami Arte Sonoro Festival (Valparaíso, Chile, 2009), installed on the public monitors of the Ministry of Justice’s Civil Registry and Identification Offices. The work occupied screens normally used for passive distraction, inserting instead the names of the 2,487 individuals who died while attempting to cross the Mexico–United States border. The installation consisted of a four-channel audio composition, a Flash animation, two video monitors, and two DVD players.
