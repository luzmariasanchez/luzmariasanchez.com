Dimensions: variable. \
Duration: 2:29 minutes. 

*Untitled [Waste Management]* seeks to incorporate the audience “inside” the landscape of the landfill. From several minutes of recorded audio/video at the Waste Management landfill in San Antonio, Texas, the final piece focuses on the repetition of a “larger-than-life” tractor traversing over, and pushing away enormous piles of garbage.
