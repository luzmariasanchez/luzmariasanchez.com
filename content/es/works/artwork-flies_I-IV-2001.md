Digital Stereophonic Sound. 3 sound loops. \
Duration: 1:30 seconds each loop.


*Flies* is an audio CD sound piece, produced in multiple. The work is comprised of audio takes of fruit flies edited together without any digital manipulation. Recorded in Oxfordshireâ€™s Braziers Park in the UK, this project isolates the sound of the fly in repetition. Each track is a loop and meant to be played for an indefinite duration.
