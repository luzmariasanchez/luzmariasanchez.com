Text-based, participatory, generative, immersive audio-visual installation exploring physical space through sound, text, moving images, AI and voice cloning. \
February 9–March 30, 2024. \
Trondheim Elektroniske Kunstsenter TEKS. Trondheim, Norway. 


***lys hvitt · lyd hvit // light white · sound white*** explores physical space through sound, generative texts, and moving images. It consists of two main audio-visual mechanisms interconnected through programming, in which the text-based element is presented as sound expanding into the exhibition space. 

  
***lys hvitt · lyd hvit // light white · sound white*** form and content are linked to my exploration of Beckett’s work: the technologised image-body-voice. And in that sense, it is the first formal artwork in which I return to the Beckettian concept of ‘language as a machine.’ I have the texts Lessness (1968) and The Lost Ones (1969) as part of my conceptual framework, as well as approaches to Beckett ideas on the body/language/machine from authors like David Porush, Anna McMullan, Derval Tubridy and Ulrika Maude.
