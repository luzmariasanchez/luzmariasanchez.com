"Vis.[un]necessary force. The Sound of Post-National Mexico" is an ongoing transdisciplinary art-research project that examines the lived experiences of civil populations amidst extreme violence in Mexico. Engaging with digital ethnography, forensic archaeology, social practice, and community-driven collaborations, the project seeks to expose and challenge the systemic violence perpetuated by both state and non-state actors through participatory art and research methodologies.

This ongoing project consists of five complex, multi-layered artworks—V.[u]nf_1 and V.[u]nf_1.01, V.[u]nf_2, V.[u]nf_3, and V.[u]nf_4—which addresses themes such as citizen journalism, complex childhood trauma, digital tools for the trackers Rastreadoras de El Fuerte, and community interaction in the search for victims of enforced disappearance. Recognised internationally, the project has received two honorary mentions from the prestigious Prix Ars Electronica (Linz) in 2020 and 2021, as well as the 1st prize at the Bienal de las Fronteras (Mexico) in 2014.
