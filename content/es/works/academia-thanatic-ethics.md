THANATIC ETHICS WORKSHOP · Université Paul-Valéry Montpellier 3
Invited speaker at the international research workshop Thanatic Ethics: The Circulation of Bodies in Migratory Spaces (October 5–6, 2023), held at Université Paul-Valéry Montpellier 3, France. The workshop brought together scholars and practitioners from multiple fields to examine the representation and memorialisation of migrant deaths, as well as the ethical, political, and cultural frameworks surrounding them*.

Luz María Sánchez presented the lecture “Accountability and the Role of Art Research in the Face of Crimes against Humanity: The Mexican Case,” grounded in her sustained transdisciplinary art-research project Vis.[un]necessary force. Her contribution explored how sonic practices can confront impunity and activate forms of counter-memory, justice, and testimony in the context of Mexico’s ongoing enforced disappearance and human rights crisis.
