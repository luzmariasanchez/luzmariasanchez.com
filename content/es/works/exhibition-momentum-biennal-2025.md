The 13th edition of the MOMENTUM biennale is an investigation and celebration of sound and an exploration of the relations between the natural and cultural worlds of Moss, Norway.


This edition is focused within the (ultra)local, inspired by, and highlighting its human and non-human inhabitants, in the city, forest, fjords and cultural landscape of Jeløy and Moss. The participating artists take local environments and localities as their impetus for further explorations.
