The 13th edition of the MOMENTUM biennale will be an investigation and celebration of sound and an exploration of the relations between the natural and cultural worlds of Moss, Norway.


MOMENTUM 13 will take place during the summer of 2025. This edition will be focused within the (ultra)local, inspired by, and highlighting its human and non-human inhabitants, in the city, forest, fjords and cultural landscape of Jeløy and Moss. The participating artists will take local environments and localities as their impetus for further explorations.


The MOMENTUM biennale was established in 1998 and is organised and produced by Galleri F 15 in Moss, Norway. For over two decades, MOMENTUM has operated as a platform for exploring the exhibition format, both in the Nordic context and with an international perspective.


The biennale is organized by Galleri F 15 with Morten Søndergaard as head curator.
