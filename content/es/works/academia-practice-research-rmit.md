"At this PRS Asia, our keynote panel will address the theme of ‘community’. Community of Practice is a focus of the PRS, and we are interested in how ideas associated with community shape our understanding of creative methodologies. Community can suggest engagement and connection but also elision, enforced silence and non-belonging. What does community mean across different creative disciplines? How does it shape knowledge? How does it scope and scale our work? What does it enable for our research?"
