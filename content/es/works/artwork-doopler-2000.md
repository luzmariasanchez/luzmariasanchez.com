Poles, string, electronic devices. \
Dimensions: variable. \
Duration: variable.


In this sound installation an actual Doppler effect is incited. Various poles are installed in the ceiling of a long corridor with attaching strings. An audio device comprised of a small chip connected to a tiny battery is mounted, in such a way, to traverse back and forth through the chain of strings. Although barely visible the chip itself is definitely audible emitting 1khz of sound. As the device travels from one end of the corridor to the other it produces an artificial Doppler effect; sound waves hit the walls from different points in time generating a “harmonic” atmosphere of sound.
