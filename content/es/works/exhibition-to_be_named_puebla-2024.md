Galería de Arte del Palacio Municipal de Puebla


The use of language has become a critical point about who has the right to define identities and realities. "Nombrar_" offers an inclusive space designed to explore and value the diverse practices of naming, recognizing the diversity of perspectives and modes of expression, with a particular emphasis on the original languages of Mexico and promoting their recognition and revitalization.

"Nombrar_" celebrates and supports naming practices as acts of creativity and empowerment. These practices not only describe the world but actively shape it, influencing social interactions and cultural perceptions.

Naming acts have a creative capacity; they shape the interactions and worlds in which they are integrated. Our objective is to foster constructive discussions about the dynamics of power and the consequences of who defines whom through naming and self-naming, highlighting the diversity and experiences of Mexico's original peoples.

By recognizing and making these practices visible, "Nombrar__Notokayotia__Nasa Katyi__" contributes to the revitalization and appreciation of the identity and cultural heritage of original peoples. Through the recognition of their languages and their ways of self-naming, a deeper respect is promoted and a broader understanding of their ancestral knowledge and values is achieved.

This exhibition seeks to showcase the diversity of naming practices while celebrating the revitalization practices of indigenous languages, providing a space for these voices to be heard and valued in all their richness. Emphasizing the importance of self-naming as an act of empowerment and self-determination, self-denominations are crucial for raising public awareness about the respect and interest that indigenous peoples deserve, combating discrimination and racism.
