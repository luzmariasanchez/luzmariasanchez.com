Violence: Seen & Heard – Bloomberg Media Group (2021) \
Video interview series | 3 parts | Total duration: 9:44 minutes \
This three-part interview series was filmed shortly after Luz María Sánchez’s forced relocation to Norway in 2021. Recorded in her temporary studio in Trondheim, it reflects a moment of political exile and transition, as her work gained increasing international attention. \
Curated by Macarena Gómez-Barris, Violence: Seen & Heard (Season 3, Episode 12 of the Art+Technology series by Bloomberg Media Group and Hyundai) presented Sánchez’s practice alongside that of Irish artist Richard Mosse. Distributed across three segments, the programme included excerpts from detritus, Vis.Fuerza [in]necesaria_1.01, Vis.Fuerza [in]necesaria_3, Vis.Fuerza [in]necesaria_4, and Post-Corpus—framing her work within global debates on state violence, affect, and media technologies. \
