· 2487 records the names of two thousand four hundred and eighty-seven people out of an estimated eight thousand who have died attempting to cross the border between Mexico and the United States since 1993.

· 2487 is constructed aurally through a collective vocal register, assembling the recorded voices of men, women, and children. Conceived as a mirrored counterpart to the original 2487—which features only the artist’s voice—it has not yet been publicly exhibited, remaining an unpublished reflection on how communal vocal participation reshapes the act of naming the dead.
