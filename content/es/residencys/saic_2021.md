The Sound Department Colloquium Series is a series of presentations by the department's visiting artists and scholars, faculty, graduate students and invited guests. The presentation on Nov. 11th will feature visiting artist Luz María Sánchez.

Sound and visual artist, Luz María Sánchez, was born in Guadalajara, Mexico where she studied both music and literature. Through her doctoral studies at the Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, she focused on the role of sound in art since its mechanical inception in the 19th century.

Working with both sound and moving images, Sánchez’s pieces are arranged to envelop the subject in a sensorial experience while preserving a feeling of physical immediacy. Her work operates in the political sphere, working with themes like the Mexican diaspora, violence in the Americas and the failure of the nation-state. Luz María Sánchez is a San Antonio resident who splits her time between San Antonio and Mexico City.
