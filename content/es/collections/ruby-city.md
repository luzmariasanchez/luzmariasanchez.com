Linda Pace Foundation was founded in 2003 as the owner and steward of Pace’s collection. Guided by its donor’s conviction that contemporary art is essential to a dynamic society, Linda Pace Foundation fosters the creation, presentation and understanding of innovative expression through contemporary art. In addition to its exhibition spaces Ruby City and Studio, Linda Pace Foundation shares its collection through loans to museums and institutions around the world. The Foundation also actively acquires new works each year, which, echoing the themes and character of Pace’s own collecting, reflect a feminist perspective, engage social issues and consider aspects of spirituality and beauty.
