Sánchez has exhibited at Ars Electronica, Linz; MUAC, Mexico City; WRO Art Biennale, Wroclaw; and ZKM, Karlsruhe. She has authored four books, curated exhibitions and conferences on new media, and presented by invitation at leading institutions such as the School of the Art Institute Chicago, the University of the Arts London UAL, and ZKM.
